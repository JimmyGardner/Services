Hey what's going on guys. Today we're going to create a services 
section using html and css. Thought this can be useful for some 
projects you can improve your UI with this thing so it's basically 
a row container holding 3 columns. We're gonna use flexbox and 
some other cool css stuff to animate the columns and this button. 
You can see that whenever you hover it kinda have a little bit of 
rotation. and this is just a box-shadow. Alright that's it and let's get 
started.
